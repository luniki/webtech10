!SLIDE TODO
  In discussions, it was agreed that further extending HTML 4.0 would be
  difficult, as would converting 4.0 to be an XML application. The proposed way
  to break free of these restrictions is to make a fresh start with the next
  generation of HTML based upon a suite of XML tag-sets.

  - "Should the W3C develop declarative extension to HTML and CSS and imperative
     extensions to DOM, to address medium level Web Application requirements, as
     opposed to sophisticated, fully-fledged OS-level APIs? (proposed by Ian
     Hickson, Opera Software)"

  - "At present, W3C does not intend to put any resources into the third
     straw-poll topic: extensions to HTML and CSS for Web Applications, other
     than technologies being developed under the charter of current W3C Working
     Groups."
  - WHAT Working Group (Web Hypertext Application Technology)

    "The Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group is a loose,
    unofficial, and open collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and
    interested parties. The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML
    and related technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
    Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a standards
    organisation. This submission would then form the basis of work on formally
    extending HTML in the standards track."
