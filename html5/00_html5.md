<blockquote>
Implementations and specifications have to do a delicate dance together. You
don't want implementations to happen before the specification is finished,
because people start depending on the details of implementations and that
constrains the specification.

However, you also don't want the specification to be finished before there are
implementations and author experience with those implementations, because you
need the feedback. There is unavoidable tension here, but we just have to muddle
on through.
